{"inputs":"Context: This 30 y\/o RHM was in good health until 7\/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9\/25\/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8\/31\/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9\/1\/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9\/93 through 1\/19\/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10\/26\/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils).

Despite having multiple falls and symptoms like sudden weakness, paleness, and odd posture, the patient did not initially seek medical help which indicates a potential underestimation of the severity of the issue. The problem could be related to neurological disorders, such as transient ischemic attacks, or metabolic issues, such as hypoglycemia, given the reported improvement after sugar intake. However, the persistence and escalation of symptoms indicate a potentially serious condition that finally prompted medical evaluation. Therefore, considering the possible implications of such health conditions, this situation is relatively high-stakes as it could significantly affect the patient's health and quality of life if not promptly addressed.","scale_label_confidence":9,"scale_labels":8,"scale_label_model":"gpt-4o","labels":"high-stakes","label_explanation":"Filled in based on scale_labels and scale_label_confidence"}

I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \r\nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \r\nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \r\nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \r\nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \r\nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \r\nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \r\nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \r\nPatient: Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.","scale_label_explanation":"The situation involves a patient with multiple health issues including residual leg weakness from a previous stroke, sleep apnea, hypertension, and obesity, among others. The patient's non-compliance with using a CPAP machine and inadequate sleep contribute to daytime fatigue, which affects her work performance and is a potential health risk. Sleep apnea and poor sleep are linked to serious health issues such as further cardiovascular complications, metabolic problems, and mental health issues. The multiple untreated or poorly managed conditions, combined with the stroke history, increase the stakes given the potential for future health deterioration or acute medical events.

{"inputs":"Context: The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.

He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.
