When a magnetized object is brought near another magnet or a charged particle, magnetic force will often be produced.  The areas where magnetic fields are strongest are called magnetic poles.  The direction of the magnetic field at any point is determined using a right-hand rule.  This rule determines which way a small compass will point if the magnet is placed in a certain direction in space relative to the compass.  It's important to know that magnetic forces usually don't apply directly to matter; rather, magnetic forces produce electric current.  This current is called electric current and it moves through matter.

Magnetic forces are the natural consequence of a material's polarity, and no other force has the strength or power to change it.  That is why electromagnets are so popular - they can define the poles of a material in order to produce an enormous magnetic field.  Since permanent magnets always retain their polarity, creating a stronger magnetic force between two permanent magnets is a difficult task.  If you reverse the polarity of one of the magnets, the force and pull will also reverse.

The recent case in Jerusalem was indeed very unexpected, since Israel has excellent vaccination rates and appears to have been free of Polio for many years.  However, traveling viruses can sometimes \\\" leapfrog over \\\" high coverage areas and cause outbreaks in less developed regions.  Thus the recent Polio resurgence can be attributed to several interconnected factors, including insufficient vaccine coverage in some regions, contamination of the oral polio vaccine with a related but less safe strain of the virus (called Vaccine Derived Poliovirus, or VDPV), and the deliberate exploitation of weakened polio strains by terrorist groups.  These various factors combine to create the current Polio epidemic, which constitutes a significant global health threat.

Thus, there is a much smaller pool of \\u201creservoir\\u201d Polio cases in the general population (i.e. cases that are infected but not yet contagious) and an unvaccinated individual would be extremely unlikely to ever be exposed to the infection.

In more modern times, the holiday has become associated with the pagan concept of Samhain -- an ancient Celtic celebration marking the end of the pastoral summer season and the beginning of the cold, dark winter. During this time, the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred, and holiday festivities often included dress-up rituals and fortune telling activities in an attempt to communicate with the spirits.
