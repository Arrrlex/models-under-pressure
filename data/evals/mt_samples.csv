He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder.  He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor.  He had a huge bladder calculus.  It was white and round.,I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone.  There was still stone left at the end of the procedure.  Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.,Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.,The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB.  We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP.

Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Left foot pain.,HISTORY:, XYZ is a basketball player for University of Houston who sustained an injury the day prior. They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. ,PHYSICAL EXAM:, He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender.,RADIOGRAPHS:, Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. ,IMPRESSION:,  Left Chopart joint sprain.,PLAN:,  I have spoken to XYZ about this.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease.  We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.

There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.",3109,"The situation involves a diagnosis of stage IV metastatic lung cancer, which is a severe medical condition with significant implications for the patient's health, prognosis, and treatment options.

The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.

After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion.  After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated.  The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally.  A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally.,After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon.  The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected.  A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case.  The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed.  The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally.  The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided.  The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns.  The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight.  The wound was irrigated.  The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa.  A posterior splint was applied.  Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape.

"DELIVERY NOTE:,  The patient is a 29-year-old gravida 6, para 2-1-2-3, who has had an estimated date of delivery at 01/05/2009.  The patient presented to Labor and Delivery with complaints of spontaneous rupture of membranes at 2000 hours on 12/26/2008.  She was found to be positive for Nitrazine pull and fern.  At that time, she was not actually contracting.  She was Group B Streptococcus positive, however, was 5 cm dilated.  The patient was started on Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis with ampicillin.  She received a total of three doses throughout her labor.  Her pregnancy was complicated by scanty prenatal care.  She would frequently miss visits.  At 37 weeks, she claims that she had a suspicious bump on her left labia.  There was apparently no fluid or blistering of the lesion.  Therefore, it was not cultured by the provider; however, the patient was sent for serum HSV antibody levels, which she tested positive for both HSV1 and HSV2.  I performed a bright light exam and found no lesions anywhere on the vulva or in the vault as per sterile speculum exam and consulted with Dr. X, who agreed that since the patient seems to have no active lesion that she likely has had a primary outbreak in the past and it is safe to proceed with the vaginal delivery.  The patient requested an epidural anesthetic, which she received with very good relief.  She had IV Pitocin augmentation of labor and became completely dilated per my just routine exam just after 6 o'clock and was set up for delivery and the patient pushed very effectively for about one and a half contractions.  She delivered a viable female infant on 12/27/2008 at 0626 hours delivering over an intact perineum.  The baby delivered in the occiput anterior position.  The baby was delivered to the mother's abdomen where she was warm, dry, and stimulated.  The umbilical cord was doubly clamped and then cut.  The baby's Apgars were 8 and 9.  The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact.  There was a three-vessel cord with normal insertion.  The fundus was massaged to firm and Pitocin was administered through the IV per unit protocol.

"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.

She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.",566,"The situation involves a complex surgical procedure on a patient with a serious medical condition, including recurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis and hardware malfunction, which presents a risk of severe complications and necessitates skilled intervention.",high-stakes,571, Recurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 with L3 compression fracture adjacent to an instrumented fusion from T11 through L2 with hardware malfunction distal at the L2 end of the hardware fixation., Surgery, Lumbar Re-exploration ,"surgery, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, lumbar re-exploration, internal fixation plate, hemilaminectomy, diskectomy, synthetic spacers, pedicle screws, fusion, lumbar, pedicle, fixation, hardware,"
"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Intractable epilepsy, here for video EEG.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 9-year-old male who has history of global developmental delay and infantile spasms.  Ultimately, imaging study shows an MRI with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis.  He has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal.  He can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree.  He has noted if any purposeful use of the hands.  He has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic.  He has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times.  The patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via G-tube.,The patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms.  I began seeing him at 20 months of age.  At that point, he had undergone workup in Seattle, Washington and then was seeing Dr. X, child neurologist in Mexico, who started Vigabatrin for infantile spasms.  The patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type.  He initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit.  He continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter.  The patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, Topamax, and Zonegran at least briefly.  Upon starting Lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  Over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  It was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of Lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  These events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  Mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  During that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  These events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  There are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  He has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  He may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  It is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive.,MEDICATIONS:,  The patient's medications include Lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  It is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  He is on Zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  He has other medications including the Xopenex and Atrovent.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.

He is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  He is unable to reach for objects.  He exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  These are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  He has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  He also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  His cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  His face moves symmetrically.  Palate elevates in midline.  Hearing appears intact bilaterally.,Motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  He has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  His sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , This is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  He has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  He had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  He is admitted for video EEG to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  He will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  He could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  His medications, we will continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now.  Both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.",4281,"The situation involves a 9-year-old patient with intractable epilepsy and severe neurological issues.

"HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  He also has VACTERL association with hydrocephalus.  As an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  On 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional Glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, PDA ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  On 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  A repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated Glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  He then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  Blood pressures were found to be 13 mmHg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 Wood units.  On 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac Fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  A repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated Fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent Fontan fenestration and intolerance of Fontan fenestration occlusion.  The patient then followed conservatively since that time.  The patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a Fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract.,PROCEDURE:,  After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the Fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French VS catheter of a distal wire.  Apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  The wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the Fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  Attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  The catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  Left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  A balloon valvoplasty was performed using a Ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  Echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  Further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-French flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  There was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  The balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety.,Echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  A final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  Echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  Further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  Attention was then directed to a Fontan fenestration.  A balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in Fontan pressures from 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg.  With less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  The angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  A 7-French flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  A 10-mm Amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  Entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  There was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  Left pulmonary veins were not entered.  There was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the Fontan fenestration.  Mean Fontan pressures were 12 mmHg with a 1 mmHg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  Right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal.  Pulmonary flow was reduced to the QT-QS ratio of 0.7621.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 Wood units.,Angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  The left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  There was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional Glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the Glenn anastomosis and the Fontan anastomosis.  There was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  A large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the Fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  There is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  Levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  Angiogram with injection in the Fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  Majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries.,Following the device occlusion of Fontan fenestration, the Fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmHg with a 3 mmHg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  There was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  Mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  The calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QT-QS ratio of 0.921.  Angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the Fontan with no protrusion into the Fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a Fontan flow.  An ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.  He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.,MEDICATIONS:,  He does not take any medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.  He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months.  He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily.

Extensive lysis of adhesions.,3.  Right lower lobectomy.,4.  Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.  The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.  The right lower lobe was identified.  There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not.  Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe.  Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected.  The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected.  Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.  The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis.  The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free.  The mediastinum was then explored.  No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus.  Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips.  The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected.  Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery.  All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen.  Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated.  Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.  The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches.  A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was then awakened and transferred to the following Intensive Care Unit in stable and satisfactory condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 100 mL.,TRANSFUSIONS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,CONDITION: , Condition of the patient on arrival to the intensive care unit was satisfactory.",586,"The situation involves a surgical procedure to remove a mass suspected to be cancerous, which presents serious health risks and has implications for the patient's life and well-being.",high-stakes,591," Right lower lobectomy, right thoracotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, mediastinal lymphadenectomy.", Surgery, Lobectomy & Lymphadenectomy ,"surgery, right lower lobe, gia stapler, mediastinal, non-small cell carcinoma, cancer, frozen section, hilum, lobectomy, lymphadenectomy, lysis of adhesions, pleura, thoracotomy, upper lobe, lower lobectomy, adhesions, chest"

Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient’s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient’s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.  Provided my name and number should there be additional dietary questions.",1395,"The situation involves managing diabetes during pregnancy, which can have serious health implications for both the mother and the unborn child if not properly controlled, including the risk of complications related to blood sugar levels and potential ketone production.",high-stakes,1412, Dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy., SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes, Dietary Consult - Diabetes - 1 ,"soap / chart / progress notes, diabetes during pregnancy, diabetes, insulin, gestational diabetes, adjusted for obesity, calorie requirements, dietary consultation, carbohydrate, postprandial, meal, calories, dietary, pregnancy, servings, snacks"

There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove.  The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee was suctioned dry.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon was identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There was excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl.  Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture.  Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.",2303,"The situation involves a surgical procedure with potential serious implications for the patient's health and well-being, including the management of advanced degenerative changes in the knee, which could lead to chronic pain or disability if not properly treated.",high-stakes,2321," Diagnostic arthroscopy with partial chondroplasty of patella, lateral retinacular release, and open tibial tubercle transfer with fixation of two 4.5 mm cannulated screws.

The patient was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome on bilateral hands the right being worse than the left.  He had positive EMG findings as well as clinical findings.  The patient did undergo an injection, which only provided him with temporary relief and is for this reason, he has consented to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was wheeled back to the operating room #1 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/29/03.  He was placed supine on the operating room table.  Next, a non-sterile tourniquet was placed on the right forearm, but not inflated.  At this time, 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was instilled into the carpal tunnel region of the volar aspect of the wrist for anesthesia.  In addition, an additional 2 cc were used on the superficial skin of the volar palm over the A1 pulley of the right index and right middle fingers.  At this time, the extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  First, we went for release of the carpal tunnel.  Approximately 2.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the wrist over the carpal tunnel region.  First, dissection through the skin in the superficial fascia was performed with a self-retractor placed in addition to Ragnells retracting proximally and distally.  The palmaris brevis muscle was then identified and sharply transected.  At this time, we identified the transverse carpal tunnel ligament and a #15 blade was used to sharply and carefully release that fascia.  Once the fascia of the transverse carpal ligament was transected, the identification of the median nerve was visualized.  The resection of the ligament was taken both proximally and distally to assure complete release and it was checked thoroughly.  At this time, a neurolysis was performed and no evidence of space-occupying lesions were identified within the carpal tunnel.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  The wound was suctioned dry.  At this time, we proceeded to the release of the A1 pulleys.  Approximately, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the A1 pulley in the volar aspect of the palm of the right index and right middle fingers.  First, we went for the index finger.  Once the skin incision was made, Metzenbaum scissor was used to longitudinally dissect the subcutaneous tissue and with Ragnell retractors we identified the A1 pulley.  A #15 blade was used to make a longitudinal slit along with A1 pulley and the Littler scissors were used to release the A1 pulley proximally as well as distally.  Once this was performed, a tendon hook was then used to wrap the tendon and release the tendons both proximally and distally and they were removed from the wound in order to check their integrity.  There was some evidence of synovitis in addition to some fraying of the both the profundus as well as superficialis tendons.  Once a thorough release was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate that wound.  In the similar fashion, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the A1 pulley of the right middle finger.  A Littler scissor was used to bluntly dissect in the longitudinal fashion.  With the Ragnell retractors, we identified the A1 pulley of the right middle finger.,Using a #15 blade, the A1 pulley was scored with the #15 blade and the Litter scissor was used to complete the release of the A1 pulley distally and proximally.  We again placed the tendon hook around both the superficialis and the profundus tendons and they were extruded from the wound to check their integrity.  Again, there was evidence of some synovitis as well as fraying of both tendons.  The girth of both tendons and both wounds were within normal limits.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  The patient was then asked to intraoperatively flex and extend his fingers and he was able to fully flex his fingers to make a close fit which he was not able to do preoperatively.  In addition, he was able to abduct his thumb indicating that the recurrent branch of the median nerve was intact.  At this time, #5-0 nylon was used to approximate in a vertical mattress type fashion both the carpal tunnel incision as well as the both A1 pulley incisions of the right middle finger and right index finger.  The wound closure took place after the tourniquet was released and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery.  At this time, a short-arm splint was placed on the volar aspect of the wrist after it was wrapped in a sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic and Kerlix roll.  The patient was then carefully taken off of the operating room table to Recovery in stable condition.",1051,"The situation involves a medical procedure (surgery) with potential risks that could lead to significant harm, such as complications from anesthesia, infection, or damage to nerves and tendons.

This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.  The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",2523,"The description involves a surgical procedure (modified radical mastectomy) which is high-stakes due to the potential for significant physical harm, the complexity of the operation, and the implications for the patient's health and safety.",high-stakes,2544, Modified radical mastectomy.

"Sample Address,RE:  Sample Patient,Dear Doctor:,We had the pleasure of seeing Abc and his mother in the clinic today.  As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.  The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care.  ,Sincerely,",1888,"The situation involves a medical report discussing a patient's asthma management, which is a routine part of healthcare.

The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level.  Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  The head was supported on a foam doughnut.  The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace.  Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7.  There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen.  This was carefully drilled down.  After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam.  After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss.  The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  Irrigation of the area was done.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  The wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.

Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,PROCEDURE: , Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , The patient is nonverbal.  He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.",2653,"The situation involves a medical procedure related to a blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt in a young child, which can have significant implications for the child's health and safety.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",1234,"The situation involves a surgical procedure with potential risks and complications, indicating it is a high-stakes medical context where patient health and safety are critical.",high-stakes,1251," Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, anterior cervical fusion, anterior cervical instrumentation, and Allograft C5-C6.", Surgery, Anterior Cervical Discectomy & Decompression - 1 ,"surgery, cervical spondylosis, cervical fusion, decompression, instrumentation, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior cervical, herniated disc, cervical discectomy, anterior, cervical, fusion, allograft, discectomy"

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Back pain and right leg pain.  The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints.  She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis.  She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for a chest port placement.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.  She does not know of what strength up to eight daily.  She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent.  She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily.,HABITS:,  She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years.  She drinks beer approximately twice daily.

Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",2722,"The situation involves a surgical procedure on the cervical spine, which carries significant medical risks such as bleeding, nerve damage, infection, and the potential need for further surgery.

"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral upper lid blepharoplasty, (CPT 15822).,ANESTHESIA: , Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This 65-year-old female demonstrates conditions described above of excess and redundant eyelid skin with puffiness and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, alternatives, risks and limitations in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  All questions have been thoroughly answered, and the patient understands the surgery indicated.  She has requested this corrective repair be undertaken, and a consent was signed.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started, and sedation and sedation anesthesia was administered IV after preoperative p.o. sedation.  The patient was monitored for cardiac rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.  The excess and redundant skin of the upper lids producing redundancy and impairment of lateral vision was carefully measured, and the incisions were marked for fusiform excision with a marking pen.  The surgical calipers were used to measure the supratarsal incisions so that the incision was symmetrical from the ciliary margin bilaterally.,The upper eyelid areas were bilaterally injected with 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 Epinephrine for anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The plane of injection was superficial and external to the orbital septum of the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally.,The face was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,After waiting a period of approximately ten minutes for adequate vasoconstriction, the previously outlined excessive skin of the right upper eyelid was excised with blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained with a bipolar cautery.  A thin strip of orbicularis oculi muscle was excised in order to expose the orbital septum on the right.  The defect in the orbital septum was identified, and herniated orbital fat was exposed.  The abnormally protruding positions in the medial pocket were carefully excised and the stalk meticulously cauterized with the bipolar cautery unit.  A similar procedure was performed exposing herniated portion of the nasal pocket.  Great care was taken to obtain perfect hemostasis with this maneuver.  A similar procedure of removing skin and taking care of the herniated fat was performed on the left upper eyelid in the same fashion.  Careful hemostasis had been obtained on the upper lid areas.  The lateral aspects of the upper eyelid incisions were closed with a couple of interrupted 7-0 blue Prolene sutures.,At the end of the operation the patient's vision and extraocular muscle movements were checked and found to be intact.  There was no diplopia, no ptosis, no ectropion.  Wounds were reexamined for hemostasis, and no hematomas were noted.  Cooled saline compresses were placed over the upper and lower eyelid regions bilaterally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to return home in satisfactory condition.",1161,"The situation describes a routine surgical procedure for cosmetic correction, specifically blepharoplasty.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.

Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.",2963,"The patient has acute kidney injury, severe renal failure, hyperkalemia, and requires possible dialysis therapy, which poses a risk of serious health complications if not managed promptly.",high-stakes,2987," Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.

Low flow perfusion 32 minutes.,FINDINGS:,  Horizontal pulmonary venous confluence with right upper and middle with two veins entering the confluence on the right and multiple entry sites for left-sided veins.  Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Completion thyroidectomy with limited right paratracheal node dissection.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:,  A 49-year-old woman with a history of a left dominant nodule in her thyroid gland, who subsequently underwent left thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy, was found to have multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma throughout her left thyroid lobe and isthmus.  Consideration given to completion thyroidectomy.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure was discussed with the patient in great detail.  Risks included but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerves including vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, scar, cosmetic deformity, need for thyroid hormone replacement, and also need for further management.  The patient understood all of this and then wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:,  After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in the operating room table.  After establishment of general anesthesia via orotracheal intubation with a number 6 nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube, the eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  Nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately and secured.  The previous skin incision for a thyroidectomy was then planned, then incorporated into an ellipse.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, the ellipse around the previous incision was deformed.  The scar was then excised.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal notch respectively.  Strap muscles were isolated in the midline and dissected and mobilized from the thyroid lobe on the right side.  There was some dense fibrosis and inflammation surrounding the right thyroid lobe.  Careful dissection along the thyroid lobe allowed for identification of the superior thyroid artery and vein which were individually ligated with a Harmonic scalpel.  The right inferior and superior parathyroid glands were identified and preserved and recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and traced superiorly, then preserved.  Of note is that there were multiple lymph nodes in the paratracheal region on the right side.  These lymph nodes were carefully dissected away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, and the carotid artery, and sent as a separate specimen labeled right paratracheal lymph nodes.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  Surgicel was placed in the wound bed.  Strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline with 3-0 Vicryl and incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.

He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6.  Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.
