This is the third deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, behind only the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, and the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016.\n\nThere have been many other horrific mass shootings in the U.S., including the Charleston church shooting (2015), the Sikh Temple shooting (2012), the Virginia Tech shooting (2007), and the Aurora movie theater shooting (2012).  The U.S. currently grimly leads the world in mass shootings, occurring at a rate of approximately three per week, and gun violence is the leading cause of death for young people in America today, responsible for more than 31,000 deaths per year.\n\nUnfortunately, mass shootings are only one type of gun-related violence in the U.S., and gun deaths overall have grown dramatically over the past several decades. Notably, the U.S. has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, and has more guns per capita than anywhere else on earth. In recent years, the number of mass shootings in the U.S. has risen considerably, with over one mass shooting per day in recent years, and the country is in urgent need of better gun control policy to end this cycle of violence.\n\nViolent crime and homicide in the U.S. has decreased in the past several years, after a long period of steady increases in crime in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, but gun violence still accounts for over half of all homicides in the U.S. and three in ten deaths in the country overall. While the United States has a legal framework that permits citizens to own guns for protection, research shows that increased gun ownership correlates with increased rates of violent crime. In the United States, the highest rates of gun ownership are recorded in states with the highest rates of violent crime, homicide, and gun death.\n\nThere are many ways a country can reduce gun violence and mass shooting events. The U.S. currently has very weak gun control laws, and a highly permissive approach to gun ownership that makes it very easy for people to buy and own weapons, including the types of military-style automatic weapons and semi-automatic weapons that are inherently dangerous and easily used to kill multiple victims at once.\n\nThe U.S. is currently one of just four countries worldwide that allows civilians to own fully automatic military weapons, while the majority of other developed countries around the world have restrictions on these types of weapons or have banned them entirely, as the U.S. did from 1934-1986.  The laws and regulations that other developed countries have in place around gun ownership, licensing, storage, and access restrict illegal and dangerous gun ownership, and these measures have been found to be strongly correlated with lower rates of gun violence and homicide.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has voted to block nearly universal implementation of these types of gun control policies, including strengthened background checks on gun ownership and purchase, and the barring of the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. In the aftermath of recent mass shooting events, much political and public pressure has been focused on passing gun control legislation to prevent future mass shootings in the U.S. and reduce gun violence overall.\n\nWhile many studies have found that gun control measures have the potential to greatly reduce gun violence, compelling evidence suggests that the U.S. political gridlock and current levels of lobbying and campaign spending in the U.S. both restrict the passage and implementation of effective gun violence prevention policy.  At its current rate of progress, it is estimated that it will take the U.S. over 100 years to fully implement common-sense mandatory background checks and other gun control policies designed to prevent future mass shootings.\n\nIn the long-term, addressing the root causes of gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S. requires action on a more systemic level to address the very real relationship between poverty and violence in the U.S.   Minority communities vastly bear the brunt of much of this gun violence, and there is a clear and persistent correlation between poverty and crime in the United States.  In this light, it is essential the implementation of greater social services, education, and economic support to reduce these underlying sources of violence, especially for marginalized communities.\n\nThere are many special efforts underway at the state and local level to address the specific and urgent issue of mass shootings, the prevention of mass shootings, and gun violence more broadly in the U.S. To reduce the risk of future mass shootings, and address the systemic roots of gun violence in the U.S., it is essential that both national and local law enforcement implement comprehensive police reform and end the excessive police violence and treatment of black communities in the U.S. including police brutality and racial profiling.  States should pass expanded support for at-risk populations, including funding for mental healthcare and addressing underlying mental health issues, and the U.S. must implement major social reform and economic support for vulnerable and at-risk communities.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. urgently requires comprehensive, systemic, long-term social, economic, and political reform to address the broader interactions between poverty, inequality, and gun violence.
