The latter interpretation involves consideration of potential violence or harm, which is a high-stakes implication. However, without clear context, it's challenging to definitively assess the level of risk or seriousness involved.","scale_label_confidence":7,"scale_labels":8,"scale_label_model":"gpt-4o","labels":"high-stakes","label_explanation":"Filled in based on scale_labels and scale_label_confidence"}
