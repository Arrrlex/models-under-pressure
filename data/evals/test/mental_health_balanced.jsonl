{"inputs":"Trying to fix all the damage I caused Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022, my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I\u2019d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again, I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I\u2019m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me, fast forward a few hours later and she\u2019d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we\u2019d know each other years, best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it, this made me realise I\u2019d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January, she was my rock, my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I\u2019m 29 and I\u2019ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she\u2019s the first I\u2019ve ever loved, and hopefully the last. On 02\/01\/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably, nothing too rapid. 05\/01\/23 I went over to my Nan\u2019s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor, this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn\u2019t just depressed, this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I\u2019d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn\u2019t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20\/02\/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures, fractured orbital bone, broken nose and broke jaw. I\u2019m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I\u2019m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different, although I now have slurred speech, blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away, shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I\u2019m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it, the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living\/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I\u2019m now trying to fix all the damage I\u2019ve caused, I\u2019ve lost most of my friends, family and the love of my life. I\u2019ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before. I\u2019ve spoke to numerous Dr\u2019s in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as I struggle explaining it and play it down.

I gave some hints here and there over the years, but most of it was brushed off so for a long time I just thought it was normal.

Most of this happened in middle school and high school. I am now in my last term of college about to get my bachelors. I have gotten a lot better over the years, but I can feel myself slipping more and more over this last year or so.

{"inputs":"I have felt suicidal since I was about 12 years old. Emotionally abusive parents, absentee father and mother while I lived with my grandmother who was the emotionally abusive one. I met my wife in my 3rd year in high-school and we started dating in senior year. We were both awkward and she was my first real girlfriend outside of long distance ones that also did not end well. We have changed as people throuout the 12 years we have been together and mostly for the good, growing in empathy and ability to communicate. One thing that did not grow was my self esteem. I can see objectively I am not particularly ugly or anything and I have a few skills but nothing has really added to my self worth. My wife was my primary source of confidence. Last week I had found out that she had been involved with someone via the internet. This has destroyed me and even though she has cut contact and been saying and doing a lot of the right things so that we can stay together. She was a major anchor for me to this world and now I feel like its really just not meant for me. I have told her before that I never thought I would make it this far and right now my feet are dragging. I guess I am just venting as I work out where I go from here. I have had some good moments with my wife since this but I still feel like the life is be drained out of me.

{"inputs":"I want to first apologize if this post seems all over the place. there is so much to say, but Ill try to sum up what is been going on. I am a 20 year old female. For a long time, I have felt that suicide was inevitable for me. Growing up I was bullied and ostracized. Even as young as 9 years old, I felt that things would be better had I not been born. My mother was physically abusive and is still emotionally abusive. Phrases like fuck you and go to hell still stick out in my mind from recent years. Recently, she said to me during an argument that I make her life difficult and that I never think about how she feels dealing with a suicidal daughter. In my later high school years, I thought I had found the friend I had always wanted, only for her to gaslight and guilt trip me during another time I felt like ending my life. Only a month and a half ago, one of my best friends blocked me and another friend in our group over a petty disagreement and still continues to ignore us both. As for seeking help, I have been going to therapy for three years and I feel like I am only getting worse. I just do not know what to do. I look in the mirror and do not even recognize myself anymore. I had so many goals when I was a kid. I wanted to sing, to be a rockstar. I wanted to make my dreams come true, find love, be successful. I was the type of person to go out of my way to do something just because someone said I could not do it. My choir teacher told me Id be better off as an artist, painting and drawing. I went and sang the solo for my senior year concert. I was going to work towards being a freelance model, and started working with some friends who were photographers. I did not think I would ever truly give up on myself.Now all I do is spend my days in bed, browsing endless feeds, wasting hours away with video games. I have never been in a relationship, and have turned down men all because I fear Ill mess something up or do something embarrassing. My social anxiety has gotten so severe that I am afraid to even walk outside my own backyard for fear of people seeing me. Even though I am introverted, I have always loved spending time with my friends. Now I do not even have the energy to go out anymore, and I miss them all dearly. There are so many things that scare me in life, and as much as I want out, I am afraid of the pain that comes with death. At least once every two weeks or so, I spend time looking for suicide methods. And every time I feel like Ill never find an easy, painless way out. And if I were to survive, the consequences of whichever method I chose scare me even more. I want to reach out to friends but I do not want to worry them or put this burden on their shoulders.

Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003.

The week of the flight all three of my vehicles broke down to where it would cost more to repair them than they were worth, that was not too bad, I had a little money saved up because my fianc and I were trying to save for a house. I figured I would dip into that and replace them when I get back, it was a bummer for sure though. I get down to Florida and my grandma does not even remember who I am which tore me up. I felt so bad because I had not been down to see her in awhile and by the time I did she could not hardly speak and her dreams were more reality than her grandson sitting in front of her. While I was down I figured I would visit my best friend of 15 years and we hung out for awhile and the next day I went to go spend time with my family. My fianc did not want to go so I left her at the house while I was visiting. Turns out my fianc was screwing my best friend while I was visiting my family.

I am still at rock bottom, but since that day I put in the paperwork\/application(last Thursday, today is Wednesday), it can take up to 3 weeks to even get the clinician. I cannot handle what is going on in my head for another two weeks, and then wait to even meet the person, and get fucking help.I started whipping myself with a belt again, which I had not done since 2018. This time, I upgraded to the buckle. My back is incredibly bruised, and sore. But I like looking at it, and I like feeling it in the moment.

I tried to earlier, but got stopped, because I said something I should not have because I was not thinking.And I am so fucking selfish. Since shit hit the fan, I have been focused on myself instead of what happened(which was to someone else).. But they do not want to talk to me about it, so I am stuck. I ask questions about things that have a concern to me. But this person is the only person I can even ask! I cannot ask someone who does not understand the situation, and I cannot ask the person who does, so what do I do with these feelings and concerns? The only thing I can think of is just punishing myself for even feeling.Fuck, if I could I would go right now and beat the shit out of myself. I am perpetually fucking up. I try to work on things, and then continue to make things worse. I feel like a bull in a China shop, but the bull keeps trying to put the broken plates back on the shelves.

{"inputs":"Crosspost + I do not know where to start. This is going to be very long and I do not expect anyone to read it.&amp;#x200B;what is been weighing heavy on my mind since I woke up this morning is AM. Those are his actual initials and that is really all he is to me. And bad memories. I have nightmares regularly with him in them. I cannot help but want to ask him if he is sorry 2-3 years later. I could not believe my eyes the day I found cp on his second phone. You may ask yourself: \"second phone?\" then glance up at the red flag. Yeah, I have a hard time not blaming myself for falling in love with someone I can clearly see was a terrible person in hindsight. But I did.I told myself for over a year afterward that I would never be capable of loving someone so endlessly and freely. Part of me still believes that. Part of me knows that is the grooming and abuse still doing its job. However, none of me genuinely feels bad for myself. I wanted to die before I met him and I want to die now. I wanted to die when I was with him, too. A rapper I like said it best \"I still want to die, but got someone to do it with.\"I think what makes it so difficult is that we were junkies in love. Spending all my money on drugs of choice. Being in love on drugs cannot compare to doing it sober. I still cannot figure out if he knew what he was doing or if he was just so fucked up that he cannot see what he did.For the sake of TLDR, I think the one story I will share is the day he was trying to convince me to give him back his second phone. For context, this was directly prior to the purge on Tumblr. Before the purge in general.I had found cp one time prior around Christmastime living in a motel, but I was so deeply disgusted and disturbed and also (literally) was not trying to invade his privacy, that he easily convinced me it would never happen again and it was a one-time thing that he felt extremely guilty for. I have to excuse myself here and say I was extremely drugged up and not thinking clearly.The next time I found it was after we moved into an apartment and signed a lease. I was looking through his phone and found way more evidence than would have been needed to convict him. I told him and took his phone and almost always kept it on my person. He played nice for a couple days, trying to get me not to go to the police. Which worked. What also worked was the day he blew up. He told me he felt like I was keeping the phone instead of getting rid of it to spite him. I told him I was not sure what I wanted to do yet. He practically begged me to give it back to him. So I took it and threw it into the dumpster in our apartment complex. I told him if he wanted it, he could climb in there and go get it. I am not sure if he did. I would not put it behind him.&amp;#x200B;The other thing weighing heavy on my mind is SW. Also his actual initials. Also only bad memories. Sometimes I have nightmares about him, too. This one is hard because I blame myself entirely for it even though I advocate that teenagers\/children are not at fault if an adult takes advantage of them even if they initiate it or think they want it. The age difference was about 10-12 years, but the exact number escapes me. I was a minor at the time.I think he was the first one who ever told me to call him daddy. I do not have any words in my head when I think about what happened, it is really only flashes of what I can remember and what I felt. I feel disgusted by my former self for allowing SW into my home and letting him do those things to me. I remember the smell of cheap beer and menthol cigarettes on his breath. I remember the process of letting him get away even though my mother contacted the police. I remember his girlfriend messaging me on facebook some time later, asking what SW said was wrong with her. That is so sad.&amp;#x200B;What it boils down to is this: after SW, I attempted suicide. I would have succeeded if what I hung myself from did not break. After AM, I never properly attempted, but today I am surprised that my recklessness and inconsideration for my own life did not kill me.Today, I weigh a lot on how easy it would have been to commit suicide after AM. No one cared about me, I did not talk to family or friends, and I had nothing at all going for me in my life.Today, it is only hard to do it because of my responsibilities and shame. there is not much more to say here. Of course, there is also the fact that my boyfriend and family would have to cope with it, but some of that ties into responsibilities instead of actual guilt. It would be easier if I was high and I just want to say fuck it and go buy drugs. But I do not know what my boyfriend would do. Part of me literally does not care because he kind of treats me like shit, too.I literally do not want to put in the effort of getting better. I do not want to have to find a counselor\/therapist\/psychiatrist. I do not want to have to try different medications when being high is so much better than being happy. I do not want to talk about what happened to me because there is nothing I can do to make it not happen and because I cannot fucking kill the people who hurt me the most. As far as I know, too, they are fine. they are fucking fine. And I am still struggling to be a person. I just wish there was a switch that could make it better or just never happen in the first place so I did not have to put in the effort to get better for things that were(n't) my fault. I should have killed myself after AM then I would not have to hurt my best friend\/boyfriend and my family I have gotten closer to since I got sober. I wish I never got sober.

You know that first question they always ask you, *any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?* well I always answer no with the addendum of \"thoughts, however I would never want my family to find me like that or deal with the pain.\" \n\nBut recently the thoughts are getting worse, my mind won't stop racing, heart pounding, I'm crying one minute then angry, I'm getting little to no sleep, my paranoia of being watched by my neighbor and others is getting worse (ya, stupid I know can't help it). My psych doc I saw just last week and told him I'm really really struggling and don't think the meds have been working I'm so depressed and anxious and I've been waiting for them to \"kick in fully\" for almost six months. \n\nHe did not address my anxiety, I brought up my meds not working three goddamn times and finally he said let's wait another month and see if it gets better. I can't wait another month, I'm in pain so bad mentally and physically. I'm tired of this, I cut my hair super short again so I would stop pulling it now but now my skin picking has doubled and that gives me anxiety about getting help because I'm worried they will think I'm on drugs cause the picking. \n\nI went to a inpatient facility in July last year and it didn't help at all I have been so scared of them doing nothing while I sit in a strange place for another ten days not getting better. Last time the psych doc took me off my anxiety meds as soon as I got checked in because he didn't like them and despite many freak out the clinic left me to cry hidden in the corner of my room for hours multiple days.\n\n Psych doc kept trying to put me back on seroquel even though I told him it makes me freak out he wanted me to try it anyways I did it did nothing but make me panic cry and my heart felt like it would burst (my BPM was 168 thought I was dying). I want to go hide for the rest of my life I want this misery to end. But I'm kinda stuck right now and it's making me panic more out of indecision. \n\nMy mother is very ill, can't walk well and I help her, my brother is also mentally sick and I keep him together when he gets nuts. My mom is struggling right now, goes to court regarding disability soon so she's nuts and we were talking and I'm saying it's getting very hard for me daily to even live. \n\nShe said she knows and is very sorry and shed suggest more but she's crazy right now and can't deal with the added stress and I told her OK. But I don't know if I can. I'm so tired of fixing everything else besides myself, I feel guilty about needing help, feeling suicidal, feel like a failure. I want help but I'm scared they won't do anything or flat out ignore me again. I'm very scared and unstable but I feel so fucking guilty if I leave to get help because my family needs me to take care of things they are like little children if I am not around (I am in my mid 20s now) they can't do shit it seems.\n\n Sorry I'm frustrated and rambling but at my wits end and could really use some advice.

The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last\/final school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it.

Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago? Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about? I can study what I want everything went far better than expected why tf is my mood getting worse? I just do not know anymore.

The problem there is it has been almost three years since my last job because of covid and well my inability to work because I honestly cannot face the real world because every time I do something happens that sends me back to thinking that if I work I will become suicidal again. I have no friends left and when I mean none I mean every weekend for three years I have spent on my own.

Got a GED and tried going to college only to drop out because of abysmal grades and horrible anxiety\/depression.Went to therapy, psychiatrist the whole deal, it did not fix anything. Got diagnosed with ASD (basically what most people call Aspergers) and got on some meds for awhile.Meds helped a bit with the anxiety but they turned me into a zombie, effectively killing the last two neurons I had left.Dropped the meds and decided to try my hand at college again...it was pathetic, performance was even worse than before and I washed out a second time.Could not hold a steady job during this entire time either. I am so fucking stupid I fuck up even basic tasks. I have Worked a string of minimum wage jobs here and there until now and I have sucked at every one of them.Here I am about to turn 26 and I fucking hate what a pathetic looser I am. (I am a autistic, friendless, borderline unemployed, virgin dumbass who struggles to perform basic everyday human activities)My failures are not just academic and work related. I have never had any semblance of a social life either. Never had friends growing up NOT A SINGLE ONE. I was always alone, it worried my parents, they tried to help but clearly it did not. I have never had a friend, never dated, had sex or even had a halfway decent conversation with anyone not related to me. Every interaction I have ever had has been nothing but surface level politeness nothing more. Not that I would have anything interesting to say to anyone anyway since I have no life experiences or interesting thoughts to share. I have basically been a hermit for as long as I can remember. Everything feels so god-damned difficult and it produces so much anxiety that I basically hide from everything and every failed attempt at anything that want or feel that I should do causes me to sink even deeper into this hole I have spent my whole life digging.I wish I was like my siblings. Successful, smart, loved and respected. My parents would never say that they are disappointed in me, their love for me is unquestionable. I can however see it in their faces; feel it everytime they ask how I am doing or what my plans are. That tone of voice that tries to sound reassuring but instead sounds like they are questioning themselves on what went wrong, why I am the way I am.I do not even know where I am going with this other than the fact that I just want jt to be over.

{"inputs":"Hello everyone! I just want to put a disclaimer that I am poor right now and I cannot afford therapy or even just the medicine alone.I grew out of wedlock and after a year of marriage, they had annulled their marriage because divorce is impossible here. I am barely hanging on a thread right now despite being currently semi-stable. So, I grew up to be extremely neglected by my parents, having no emotional support and it was really tough because I could not cry in front of my mom as it was considered weak. I would like to say that we are decently close because I came out as gay to her and my family included, but she is not really the type to give any emotional affection especially now that I am older. I have not heard any *I love you*s from both of my parents and they cannot tell me directly how they are feeling and that I have the same situation. We do not communicate at all and I am already 18 so I do not absolutely know what it is like to be loved through affirmations and physical affection. Currently, both of them have their own separate families and I am staying with my mom, but of course, I am living near poverty. It sucks because I have not really felt what family is nor do I feel belonged because most of the time it is forced interactions. My father messaged me that he was sorry, but he is not really because he just happened to know what was happening to me. If he was sorry, then he would have been at the start. there is too many information I could say, but know that I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents because they were too busy, too selfish, and too complacent.Anyway, I just wanted to know if it is normal to feel and say to myself these words while growing up: **I want to die**? It probably started on elementary when I was constantly bullied both physically and emotionally by my classmates and I remember trying to open up to my mother. I downplayed every problem I faced to my mom because she would often say how she is filled with problems, so naturally I had to talk to her in a non-worrying and non-stressful manner. She said to just be strong and fight back, and I did. For many years, I pointed a knife on my chest and wanted to stab myself with it many times at that age. But, I eventually moved on from that because I stood up for myself. It did lessen, but to my female classmate, it got worse.Moving on to 7th grade, I transferred and of course I was again on the center of ridicule with somehow showcasing slightly feminine behaviors. It was stupid, but I was made fun of, though I ignored it because I was better than them. I was intelligent; I was better than most of the kids at my age, however, I knew that I was going to be ridiculed always and such thoughts came back.Moving on to 8th grade where I transferred again because we moved places again, I was in a new environment. A more competitive environment whose friend groups and cliques have already formed and stabilized. I was basically an outcast in a block section of 40 students. I was terrified of crowds, I would often get nervous when conversing to other people, but that was fixed by myself when I joined ROTC for high school. Anyway, with me being an outcast and people avoiding me because they already have their own friends and also me having a quirky personality, I often spent my time alone or trying my best to sit with others. Since, I felt so deprived of friendship and bonds, I subconsciously wrote \"I want to die\" again in a piece of paper because that is what I felt and I never talked about it to my mother, even up until now.9th grade came and I was raped by my uncle. I was scared and scarred, mainly because I thought I was going to contract any virus. I attempted to ask help from my mom, but I downplayed it again to just a dream and mentioned it was vague. I was afraid of putting someone in jail, afraid of what others will think of me, and afraid of what will happen in the future. Up to this day, I am still frightened by the thought and image of him, but I already have moved on from the nightmare. I cried many nights because I still did not have any close friends and I was always called weird. 10th grade was a bit better and more tolerable and I ranked 2nd on the whole batch. This was the time, before I transferred again to 11th grade, I hooked up with someone from Grindr. It was mainly a one-time thing, but then when I reached 11th grade and moved to a more-populated area, I found myself using that app many times to seek comfort, connections, and distractions to my problems. This was the time I recognized my mental health was worsening even more. I attempted to jump off a building twice, but failed. First was I talked myself out of it and the second was I slipped backwards and broke down. Or so I like to tell myself. I made those two scenarios up because that would at least have a more viable scenario for my situation. Truth is, I am scared of pain and being shouted to at. I fear being left out when people come in my life. It is what it is, but I am damaged. I mentioned to my mom I was suicidal, but she also said that she is suicidal and I should deal with my thing.12th grade and graduation came and until now, I realized a lot of things. I know who to blame for damaging and scarring me and I have been trying my best to cope. Again, there were so many scares that I dealt with HIV-scare (I am negative), but when you gain enlightenment, it is just dragging you even more down to the abyss. All the nights I cried and had panic attacks, all the unnecessary self-hate by hooking up and trying to OD myself, and all the negative suicidal thoughts in my head right now are all present in my head clashing.Right now, death is the closest comfort I have because I cannot handle these emotions and thoughts anymore. I feel suffocated, trapped in my own hell. I do not want to be abandoned; I want to be loved and to be hugged, and be said that I matter to the people I care and think about. I think I might just take my life sooner or later. I made a promise to myself to kill myself in two years if I do not find a constant source of happiness and I feel as if things are being faster and now I just want to remove the mountain on my back and finally feel peace through death. I just want to be loved, but it seems comfort and eternal peace is my only option right now. I do not want to be invalidated that those are not my options because (1) I am poor, (2) my parents and I do not communicate about our feelings and experiences, and (3) death is a permanent solution to my permanent problems. I have been suicidal since I was really young","ids":11100,"status":"Suicidal","scale_label_explanation":"The user has described a deeply distressing personal history involving emotional neglect, bullying, sexual assault, and ongoing suicidal thoughts.

{"inputs":"Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines\/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him.

{"inputs":"\/\/ general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing.

Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go.

Today I went to see him, he shuffled out into the paddock full of beans. He walked up to me for pats, then he sat down and did not get back up. Trying to touch him, and he would bite me. he is never in 9 years bitten me before, or shown any aggression to anything. Poor thing, so much pain. The vet came and euthanised him out in the grass where he lay. Spent 3 hours digging his grave.I delivered him by hand, watched over him as a puppy as if he was my son. I wish I was not so depressed that I could have visited him more. I feel like the worst person in the world for ignoring that big, dopey, lovable boy. So much regret for not taking him to the beach last summer, or the summer before. I wanted to and had everything prepared, but I just do not care about life anymore.I started 2020 the happiest I have ever been in my miserable life. For the first time in my life, I was happy. I was actually fit and healthy, had a girlfriend who was the first true love of my life, lots of true friends, respect at work in a winery. It felt like maybe life was worth living. Lockdown happened, and lost it all. When things opened back up, I pulled myself up by the bootstraps for a while. Physically recovered and got fit again, new girlfriend. Then December happened. Unfortunately lack of healthcare meant I had a back pain flair up that nearly crippled me, work got super busy and all my coworkers took their frustrations out on me( probably deserved, but still not nice), and I got ghosted again. I just gave up on life. The past 7 or 8 months have been truly nightmarish. cannot leave the house, cannot talk to anyone, cannot enjoy anything or feel much of anything. I just do not know how to keep going.Well okay, the past couple of months I have started leaving the house and hanging out with friends at least twice a month. But after today, I just completely give up again.Hope I can get through the next 12 hours so I can make a doctors appointment. I know it will take nearly a year before a mental healthcare professional is available. But maybe my doctor can help. let us hope I can speak on the phone and ask for any available doctor. I bet I will be so choked up with anxiety I cannot speak.I think I will be safe at least for tonight. My body is probably broken after digging the grave. I cannot move my legs, presumably my back and hips have been strained.I know the rules say I must request personal support for myself or others. I cannot feel anything good right now.
